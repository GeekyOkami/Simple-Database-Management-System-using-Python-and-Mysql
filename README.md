# Simple-Database-Management-System-using-Python-and-Mysql
Created a simplistic version of Database Management system using Python and connecting it to Mysql to help young children/people who are unaware of coding and help them develop a keen understanding of CRUD operations in a fun way and develop interest for Data science at an early age. Tkinter library of python is used to develop the GUI.
